                Question 17: What is the time complexity for inserting an
                element at the beginning of a singly linked list?
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> The time complexity for inserting an
                element at the beginning of a singly linked list is O(1), as you
                only need to update the pointer of the new node to the current
                head.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 18: Describe a real-world application where a
                LinkedList is preferable over an array.
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> LinkedLists are preferable in
                applications like music playlists, where songs can be
                dynamically added or removed, and continuous traversal through
                the list is required.
              </p>

                Question 19: Can we use a LinkedList to implement a priority
                queue? Explain how.
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Yes, a priority queue can be
                implemented using a LinkedList by maintaining the list in sorted
                order based on priority. Insertion involves traversing the list
                and inserting the new element at the appropriate position.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 20: Write two advantages of a doubly linked list over a
                singly linked list.
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Efficient traversal in both directions (forward and backward).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Deletions can be done more efficiently as you have access to
                  both the next and previous nodes.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>
                Question 21: Explain the concept of a circular doubly linked
                list.
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> A circular doubly linked list is a
                variation of a doubly linked list where the last node’s next
                pointer points to the first node, and the first node’s previous
                pointer points to the last node. This allows traversal in both
                directions without needing a NULL reference.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 22: How do you delete the last node of a singly linked
                list?
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>Traverse the list to the second-to-last node.</li>
                <li>Set its next pointer to NULL.</li>
                <li>Free the memory of the last node.</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>
                Question 23: How does garbage collection work in the context of
                LinkedLists?
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Garbage collection automatically
                frees up memory by removing nodes that are no longer referenced.
                When a node in a LinkedList is deleted, its memory is
                deallocated if no other references to that node exist.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 24: Describe how you would implement a circular queue
                using a LinkedList.
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> In a circular queue using a
                LinkedList, the rear node’s next pointer is set to the front
                node to maintain the circular nature of the queue. Insertions
                are done at the rear, and deletions occur at the front.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 25: Write an algorithm to find the middle node of a
                singly linked list in one traversal.
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Initialize two pointers: a slow pointer and a fast pointer.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Move the slow pointer one step and the fast pointer two steps
                  at a time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  When the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, the slow
                  pointer will be at the middle node.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h2>
                Question 26: How would you detect a loop in a LinkedList without
                using extra memory?
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also
                known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm) can detect a loop
                using two pointers (slow and fast) without extra memory. The
                fast pointer moves two steps, and the slow pointer moves one
                step. If they meet, a loop exists.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 27: Explain why LinkedLists are not ideal for random
                access of elements.
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> LinkedLists are not ideal for random
                access because, unlike arrays, there is no direct index-based
                access. To access an element, you must traverse the list from
                the head, which takes O(n) time.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 28: Write the advantages and disadvantages of a singly
                linked list.
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Advantages:</strong> Efficient memory usage, dynamic
                  resizing, and fast insertions/deletions at the beginning.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> No backward traversal, slow
                  random access (O(n)), and higher memory usage due to pointers.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>
                Question 29: Describe a scenario where a circular linked list
                would be more efficient than a singly linked list.
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> A circular linked list is more
                efficient in scenarios like implementing a round-robin scheduler
                in operating systems, where processes are cycled through
                repeatedly, as it allows continuous looping without needing to
                restart from the head.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Question 30: How do you insert a node at a specific position in
                a singly linked list?
              </h2>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Traverse the list to the node just before the desired
                  position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Create a new node and set its next pointer to the next node in
                  the list.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Set the next pointer of the previous node to the new node.
