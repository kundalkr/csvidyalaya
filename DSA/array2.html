              11. Find the address of X[20] if the base address of a
              one-dimensional array X is 5000, each element occupies 4 bytes,
              and the array indexing starts at -5.
            </h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>To find the address, we use:</p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Address of X[i] = Base Address + ((i - Starting Index) * Size

            </p>
            <p>
              Here, base address = 5000, starting index = -5, i = 20, and size

              >

              16. What is the time complexity to insert an element at the end of

            </h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Inserting an element at the end of an array takes constant time,
              as no shifting of elements is needed. The time complexity for this
              operation is <strong>O(1)</strong>.

            </h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              To delete an element from the middle of an array, all elements
              after the deleted element must be shifted one position to the
              left. The time complexity for this operation is
              <strong>O(n)</strong>, where n is the number of elements in the
              array.

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              In an unsorted array, the element being searched for could be at
              any position or may not be present. In the worst case, we would
              have to compare the target element with all elements of the array.
              Therefore, the maximum number of comparisons is
              <strong>n</strong>.

            <h3>19. How can you reverse an array in place?</h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              To reverse an array in place, you can swap the elements at the
              start and the end of the array, then move inward until all
              elements have been swapped. The time complexity of this operation
              is
              <strong>O(n)</strong>, where n is the number of elements in the
              array.

            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Accessing an element in an array using its index takes constant
              time, as we can directly compute the memory address using the
              formula. The time complexity is <strong>O(1)</strong>.

              21. How does the insertion of an element at the beginning of an

            </h3>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Inserting an element at the beginning of an array requires
              shifting all other elements one position to the right. This makes
              the time complexity of the insertion operation
              <strong>O(n)</strong>, where n is the number of elements in the
