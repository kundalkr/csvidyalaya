                  Question 16: What is the significance of the front pointer
                  in a queue?

                <p>
                  The front pointer in a queue tracks the position of the
                  element to be dequeued next. After each dequeue operation,
                  the front pointer is incremented. In a circular queue, when
                  the front pointer reaches the end of the array, it wraps
                  around to the beginning.

            <h2>
              Question 17: Describe how the queue is used in a round-robin
              scheduling algorithm.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              In a round-robin scheduling algorithm, a queue is used to manage
              processes. Each process is added to the queue and given a time
              slice to execute. After its time slice is over, the process is
              moved to the rear of the queue, and the next process at the
              front is given the CPU. This ensures fair allocation of
              resources.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 18: What is the space complexity of a queue implemented
              using a linked list?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              The space complexity of a queue implemented using a linked list
              is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. Each
              node in the linked list requires space for storing the data and
              the reference to the next node.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 19: How can you detect whether a queue is full in a
              circular queue implementation?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              In a circular queue, the queue is full when the next position of
              the rear pointer equals the front pointer (i.e., (rear + 1) %
              size == front). This indicates that all positions are occupied
              and no more elements can be added until some are removed.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 20: Write two real-world examples of a queue data
              structure.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              1. A line of customers waiting at a bank teller.<br>2. A queue
              of packets waiting to be processed by a router in a network.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 21: Explain why a queue is suitable for breadth-first
              search (BFS) in graph traversal.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              In BFS, nodes are visited in the order of their distance from
              the starting node. A queue is suitable because it maintains the
              order of nodes, ensuring that the first node visited is the
              first one whose neighbors are explored. This maintains the
              level-order exploration, as required by BFS.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 22: What is the time complexity of checking whether a
              queue is empty?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              The time complexity of checking whether a queue is empty is
              O(1). This operation typically involves comparing the front and
              rear pointers to see if they indicate an empty queue.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 23: How can a priority queue be implemented using a
              regular queue?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              A priority queue can be implemented using a regular queue by
              inserting elements into the queue based on their priority.
              Instead of always adding elements to the rear, elements are
              inserted in the appropriate position such that the
              highest-priority element is at the front of the queue.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 24: Why is a queue not suitable for depth-first search
              (DFS)?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              A queue is not suitable for DFS because it explores nodes in
              FIFO order, which is not compatible with the depth-first nature
              of DFS. DFS requires a LIFO structure (stack) to explore nodes
              deeper in the graph before returning to previous levels, while a
              queue would explore nodes level by level, like in BFS.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 25: Give a situation where a double-ended queue (deque)
              would be useful.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              A double-ended queue (deque) is useful in a scenario like a
              sliding window in real-time analytics, where elements need to be
              added or removed from both ends of a data stream. For example,
              in tracking the highest temperature in the past hour, a deque
              can be used to quickly add new temperature readings and remove
              old ones from both ends.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 26: What happens if you try to enqueue an element in a
              full queue?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              If you try to enqueue an element in a full queue, it will result
              in an overflow condition. In such cases, there is no available
              space to add the new element, and the operation cannot be
              performed. Proper error handling should be implemented to avoid
              overflow issues.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 27: Explain the role of a queue in a printer spooler
              system.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              In a printer spooler system, print jobs are stored in a queue.
              The first job added to the queue is printed first (FIFO). New
              print jobs are added to the rear of the queue, while the printer
              processes jobs from the front. This ensures that jobs are
              printed in the order they were submitted.
            </p>

            <h2>Question 28: How does a queue help in load balancing?</h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              In load balancing, a queue is used to distribute tasks among
              multiple servers. Incoming tasks are added to the queue, and
              each server processes tasks from the front of the queue. This
              ensures an even distribution of workload and prevents any one
              server from becoming overloaded.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 29: Describe the working of a queue in an elevator
              system.
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              In an elevator system, floors requested by users are added to a
              queue. The elevator processes requests in a sequential manner,
              visiting the floors in the order they were added (FIFO). This
              ensures fairness in serving the floors and avoids skipping over
              floors requested earlier.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Question 30: What is the significance of the modulo operator in
              a circular queue?
            </h2>
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              The modulo operator is used in a circular queue to wrap the
              front and rear pointers around when they reach the end of the
              queue. This ensures that the pointers stay within the bounds of
              the array and effectively make the queue circular (i.e., rear =
              (rear + 1) % size).
