          1. Find the address of LA[25], if the base address of a
          one-dimensional linear array (LA) is 5000, and each element of the
          array occupies 4 bytes.
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find the address of LA[25], we use the formula for calculating the
          address of an element in a one-dimensional array:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Address of LA[i] = Base Address + (i * Size of each
            element)</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, the base address = 5000, i = 25, and the size of each element =
          4 bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Address of LA[25] = 5000 + (25 * 4) = 5000 + 100 = 5100</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>So, the address of LA[25] is 5100.</p>

          2. Given an array of size 10, what would be the index of the 7th
          element in 0-based indexing?
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          In 0-based indexing, the first element has index 0. Therefore, the 7th
          element in the array would have index 6.

        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find the address , we use the formula for calculating the address
          of an element in a one-dimensional array:
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          Here, base address = 2000, i = 5, and size of each element = 2 bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Address of LA[5] = 2000 + (5 * 2) = 2000 + 10 = 2010</strong>

          4. What is the difference between row-major and column-major order in
          the context of arrays?
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          In <strong>row-major order</strong>, elements of a multi-dimensional
          array are stored row by row, meaning elements of the first row are
          stored first, followed by the second row, and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>column-major order</strong>, elements are stored column by
          column, meaning elements of the first column are stored first,
          followed by the second column, and so on.

          indexing starts from 5 instead of 0.
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find the address of LA[12], we use the formula for calculating the
          address of an element in a one-dimensional array:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, base address = 1200, starting index = 5, i = 12, and size of
          each element = 8 bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Address of LA[12] = 1200 + ((12 - 5) * 8) = 1200 + (7 * 8) = 1200 +

        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find the index of the 100th element, we add 99 to the starting
          index:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Index of the 100th element = -50 + 99 = 49</strong></p>
        <p>So, the index of the 100th element is 49.</p>

          1-based indexing.
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

        <p>Using 1-based indexing, the address is calculated using:</p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Address of A[i] = Base Address + ((i - 1) * Size of each

        </p>
        <p>
          Here, base address = 3000, i = 20, and size of each element = 4 bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Address of A[20] = 3000 + ((20 - 1) * 4) = 3000 + (19 * 4) = 3000 +

        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find the index of the 30th element, we add 29 to the starting
          index:
        </p>
        <p><strong>Index of the 30th element = 10 + 29 = 39</strong></p>
        <p>So, the index of the element in the 30th position is 39.</p>

        </h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To find the address of, we use the formula for calculating the address
