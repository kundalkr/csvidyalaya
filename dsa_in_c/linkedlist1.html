            <h2>LinkedList in DSA</h2>
            <p>
              A linkedlist is a linear data structure in which elements are
              stored in nodes, and each node contains a reference (or link) to
              the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient
              insertion and deletion of elements.
            </p>

            <h3>Methods of LinkedList</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Insertion: Add a new node to the linked list.</li>
              <li>Deletion: Remove a node from the linked list.</li>
              <li>
                Traversal: Access each node in the linked list sequentially.
              </li>
              <li>
                Searching: Find a node in the linked list based on a value.
              </li>
              <li>Reversing: Change the order of nodes in the linked list.</li>
              <li>
                Sorting: Arrange nodes in a specific order based on their
                values.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Need of LinkedLists</h3>
            <p>
              Linked lists are needed when we require a data structure that
              allows for dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertion and
              deletion, and flexibility in size. They are particularly useful in
              applications where the number of elements fluctuates frequently,
              or in implementing complex data structures like stacks, queues,
              and graphs.
            </p>
   
        </div>
        <h2 id="fstque">Question 1: What is a LinkedList? Explain its basic structure.</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A LinkedList is a linear data structure where elements are stored in
          nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence. Unlike
          arrays, LinkedLists do not require contiguous memory locations. A
          typical node in a LinkedList contains two parts: the data and a
          pointer/reference to the next node. In the case of a doubly linked
          list, a node also contains a reference to the previous node.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 2: Compare a LinkedList and an Array. What are the key
          differences?
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Memory Allocation:</strong> LinkedLists use dynamic memory
            allocation, while arrays use static memory allocation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Size:</strong> Arrays have a fixed size, while LinkedLists
            can grow and shrink dynamically.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Access Time:</strong> Arrays provide O(1) time complexity
            for accessing elements by index, while LinkedLists take O(n) for
            accessing an element since it requires traversal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Insertions/Deletions:</strong> Insertions and deletions are
            more efficient in LinkedLists compared to arrays because no shifting
            of elements is required.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          Question 3: Describe the difference between a singly linked list and a
          doubly linked list.
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Singly Linked List:</strong> Each node in a singly linked
            list has data and a pointer to the next node.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Doubly Linked List:</strong> Each node in a doubly linked
            list contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the
            previous node, allowing traversal in both directions.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          Question 4: Explain how memory is managed in a LinkedList compared to
          an Array.
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> In a LinkedList, memory is allocated
          dynamically for each new node, and nodes are not necessarily stored in
          contiguous locations in memory. This makes LinkedLists flexible in
          size. In contrast, arrays require a contiguous block of memory, and
          their size is fixed upon initialization.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 5: How do you traverse a singly linked list? Write a
          step-by-step approach.
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Start from the head node.</li>
          <li>Access the data part of the current node.</li>
          <li>
            Move to the next node using the reference (pointer) to the next
            node.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeat the above steps until the next node is NULL, which indicates
            the end of the list.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Question 6: In which scenarios would you prefer using a LinkedList
          over an Array?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> LinkedLists are preferred when the size of
          the data structure is not known in advance and frequent insertions and
          deletions are required. LinkedLists are also suitable for applications
          where memory is a concern since they donâ€™t require contiguous memory
          allocation.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 7: Write two applications of the queue data structure using
          LinkedList.
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Job Scheduling in Operating Systems: The queue is used to manage
            processes that are to be executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm: A queue is used to keep track
            of the nodes that need to be explored in BFS.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Question 8: How can you implement a stack using a LinkedList?</h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a stack, the "push" operation can be implemented by inserting a
            new node at the beginning of the LinkedList.
          </li>
          <li>
            The "pop" operation can be implemented by deleting the first node
            (head) of the LinkedList.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          Question 9: Write the algorithm to delete a node from the middle of a
          singly linked list.
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Traverse the list to the node just before the one you wish to
            delete.
          </li>
          <li>
            Change the pointer of the current node to point to the node after
            the one to be deleted.
          </li>
          <li>Delete the node by freeing its memory.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Question 10: Describe the advantages and disadvantages of using a
          circular linked list.
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Advantages:</strong> A circular linked list allows efficient
            traversal, as the last node points back to the first node, making it
            ideal for applications like round-robin scheduling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Disadvantages:</strong> It is more complex to implement, and
            care must be taken to avoid infinite loops during traversal.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          Question 11: What happens if you try to access a null pointer in a
          LinkedList?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> Attempting to access a null pointer will
          result in a segmentation fault or runtime error, as the pointer does
          not reference any valid memory location.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 12: Write an algorithm to reverse a singly linked list.
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Initialize three pointers: <code>prev</code> (set to NULL),
            <code>current</code> (set to head), and <code>next</code> (set to
            NULL).
          </li>
          <li>
            Iterate through the list and at each node, reverse the pointer to
            point to the previous node.
          </li>
          <li>
            Update the <code>prev</code>, <code>current</code>, and
            <code>next</code> pointers accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the current node is NULL, set the head to
            <code>prev</code> (the last node).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Question 13: Explain how a doubly linked list can be used to implement
          a browserâ€™s forward and back navigation functionality.
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> In a doubly linked list, each node
          represents a webpage, and the previous and next pointers allow for
          forward and backward navigation. The browserâ€™s back button moves to
          the previous node, while the forward button moves to the next node.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 14: How do you insert a node at the end of a singly linked
          list?
        </h2>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Traverse the list to the last node.</li>
          <li>Create a new node and set its pointer to NULL.</li>
          <li>Set the pointer of the last node to the new node.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>
          Question 15: In a circular linked list, how do you detect if a loop
          exists?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution:</strong> You can detect a loop using Floydâ€™s
          Cycle-Finding Algorithm, which uses two pointers: a slow pointer
          (moves one step) and a fast pointer (moves two steps). If thereâ€™s a
          loop, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
