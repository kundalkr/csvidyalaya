          <h2>What Is Queue in Data Structures and Algorithms</h2>
          <p>
            A Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First
            Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the
            queue will be the first one to be removed. Queues are used in
            various applications such as scheduling tasks, handling requests in
            web servers, and managing resources in concurrent programming.
          </p>

          <h3>Methods of Queue</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Enqueue: Adds an element to the end of the queue.</li>
            <li>Dequeue: Removes an element from the front of the queue.</li>
            <li>
              Peek: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
            </li>
            <li>isEmpty: Checks whether the queue is empty.</li>
            <li>Size: Returns the number of elements in the queue.</li>
            <li>Clear: Removes all elements from the queue.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Need of Queue in Linked List</h3>
          <p>
            Queues are often implemented using linked lists because linked lists
            allow for dynamic sizing and efficient insertion and deletion of
            elements. Using a linked list for a queue can help avoid the issues
            of overflow that may occur with array-based implementations, as the
            size of the queue can grow and shrink as needed without the
            constraints of a predefined limit. This is especially beneficial in
            applications where the number of elements cannot be predicted in
            advance.

            <h2 id="fstque">Question 1: What is a Queue data structure?</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="solution">
            <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
            <p>
              A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First
              Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the element that is added
              first is the one to be removed first. It is analogous to a
              real-world queue where the first person in line is the first one
              to be served. It supports two main operations: enqueue (to add an
              element) and dequeue (to remove an element).
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Question 2: Explain the difference between a queue and a stack.</h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          A queue follows the FIFO principle, whereas a stack follows the Last
          In First Out (LIFO) principle. In a queue, the element inserted first
          is the one removed first, while in a stack, the element added last is
          the one removed first. For example, in a stack, items are added and
          removed from the same end, but in a queue, elements are added at one
          end (rear) and removed from the other (front).
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 3: Describe the enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue.
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          In the enqueue operation, an element is added to the rear of the
          queue. In the dequeue operation, the element at the front of the queue
          is removed. If the queue is empty, dequeue operation cannot be
          performed. Both operations maintain the FIFO structure of the queue.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 4: Write two applications of the queue data structure.</h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          1. Job scheduling in operating systems.<br />2. Managing tasks in a
          printer queue where the first document submitted is printed first.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 5: What is a circular queue?</h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          A circular queue is a type of queue where the last position is
          connected back to the first position to make a circle. It overcomes
          the limitations of a linear queue by making use of unused space. In a
          circular queue, the front and rear pointers wrap around when they
          reach the end of the queue.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 6: How does a circular queue handle the enqueue operation
          when the rear pointer reaches the end of the array?
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          In a circular queue, when the rear pointer reaches the end of the
          array, it wraps around to the beginning of the array if there is space
          available (i.e., if the front pointer is not at the start). This
          wrap-around is handled using modulo arithmetic (rear = (rear + 1) %
          size).
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 7: Explain how a priority queue differs from a regular queue.
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          In a priority queue, each element has a priority, and elements are
          dequeued based on their priority rather than their order of arrival.
          The element with the highest priority is dequeued first. In contrast,
          a regular queue follows the FIFO order, where the first element added
          is the first one removed, regardless of priority.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 8: What is the time complexity of the enqueue and dequeue
          operations in a queue implemented using an array?
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          The time complexity of both enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue
          implemented using an array is O(1) because these operations only
          involve incrementing or decrementing pointers (rear and front) without
          the need to traverse the array.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 9: In what situations is a circular queue more efficient than
          a linear queue?
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          A circular queue is more efficient than a linear queue in situations
          where memory utilization is critical, such as in embedded systems or
          memory-constrained environments. Since a circular queue allows the
          reuse of space freed by dequeued elements, it makes better use of the
          allocated memory.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 10: What is a dequeue (double-ended queue)?</h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          A dequeue, or double-ended queue, is a data structure that allows
          insertion and removal of elements from both ends (front and rear). It
          supports operations like enqueue at the front, enqueue at the rear,
          dequeue from the front, and dequeue from the rear.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 11: Describe a situation where a queue would be a better
          choice than a stack.
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          A queue is a better choice than a stack in situations where order
          matters. For example, in a customer service system where customers are
          served in the order they arrive, a queue ensures that the first
          customer is served first (FIFO). In contrast, a stack would serve the
          last customer first (LIFO), which is not suitable in this case.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 12: Explain how a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm uses a
          queue.
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          The BFS algorithm uses a queue to explore nodes level by level in a
          graph or tree. Initially, the root node is enqueued. Then, nodes are
          dequeued one by one, and their unvisited neighbors are enqueued. This
          ensures that nodes are explored in the order of their distance from
          the starting node, following the FIFO principle.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 13: How can a queue be used to implement a cache mechanism?
        </h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          A queue can be used to implement a First In, First Out (FIFO) cache
          mechanism. When a new item is added to the cache and the cache is
          full, the oldest item (the one that was added first) is removed from
          the front of the queue, and the new item is added to the rear. This
          ensures that the cache always contains the most recently added items.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 14: >What is the purpose of a rear pointer in a queue?</h2>

        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          The rear pointer in a queue keeps track of the position where the next
          element will be inserted. In a queue implemented using an array, the
          rear pointer is incremented after each enqueue operation. In a
          circular queue, the rear pointer wraps around to the beginning of the
          array when it reaches the end.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Question 15: What will happen if you try to dequeue an element from an
          empty queue?
        </h2>
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>Solution : </strong></p>
        <p>
          If you try to dequeue an element from an empty queue, it will result
          in an underflow condition. In such cases, there is no element to
          remove, and the operation cannot be performed. Proper error handling
          should be implemented to avoid underflow issues.
