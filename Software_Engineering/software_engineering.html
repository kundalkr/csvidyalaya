                The rapid application development model is a software
                development methodology that focuses on building prototypes
                rapidly and getting user’s feedback.

                Question 3: Explain how the uses of software engineering
                principles help to develop software products cost-efectively and

            <div class="solution">
              <p>
                Software engineering’s primary benefit is a structured approach
                of s/w development by adhering to well-defined processes and
                methodologies. Software engineering ensures that projects are
                completed on time within budget and to the required quality
                standards.

                The uses of SE principles helps to develop sw products cost
                effectively and on time as explained below:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <i>Cost effectiveness :</i>Structured software engineering
                  practices help manage project cost effectively by ensuring
                  efficient Resource Planning and utilisation. by using well
                  defined process and methodologies, software engineering
                  reduces the risk of budget overruns and delays. cost effective
                  project management is crucial for both small and large scale
                  projects, enabling organisation to achieve their goals without
                  financial strain
                </li>
                <li>
                  <i>Timely Delivery : </i>Software engineering methodologies
                  ensure the timely delivery of software projects. These
                  Frameworks promote iterative development, continuous feedback
                  and regular updates. It ensures that the progress is going
                  according to schedule and also maintains clients'
                  satisfaction.
