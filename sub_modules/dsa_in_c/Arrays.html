      <h3>
        1. Find the address of LA[25], if the base address of a one-dimensional
        linear array (LA) is 5000, and each element of the array occupies 4
        bytes.
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        To find the address of LA[25], we use the formula for calculating the
        address of an element in a one-dimensional array:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Address of LA[i] = Base Address + (i * Size of each element)</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, the base address = 5000, i = 25, and the size of each element = 4
        bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Address of LA[25] = 5000 + (25 * 4) = 5000 + 100 = 5100</strong>
      </p>
      <p>So, the address of LA[25] is 5100.</p>

        2. Given an array of size 10, what would be the index of the 7th element
        in 0-based indexing?
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        In 0-based indexing, the first element has index 0. Therefore, the 7th
        element in the array would have index 6.

        3. Given a 1D array of size 10, what will be the address of the 5th
        element if the base address is 2000 and each element occupies 2 bytes?
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        To find the address , we use the formula for calculating the address of
        an element in a one-dimensional array:
      </p>

        Here, base address = 2000, i = 5, and size of each element = 2 bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Address of LA[5] = 2000 + (5 * 2) = 2000 + 10 = 2010</strong>

        4. What is the difference between row-major and column-major order in
        the context of arrays?
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        In <strong>row-major order</strong>, elements of a multi-dimensional
        array are stored row by row, meaning elements of the first row are
        stored first, followed by the second row, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>column-major order</strong>, elements are stored column by
        column, meaning elements of the first column are stored first, followed
        by the second column, and so on.

        5. Find the address of LA[12] if the base address of a one-dimensional
        array LA is 1200, and each element occupies 8 bytes. Assume that array
        indexing starts from 5 instead of 0.
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        To find the address of LA[12], we use the formula for calculating the
        address of an element in a one-dimensional array:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Address of LA[i] = Base Address + ((i - Starting Index) * Size of
          each element)</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, base address = 1200, starting index = 5, i = 12, and size of each
        element = 8 bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Address of LA[12] = 1200 + ((12 - 5) * 8) = 1200 + (7 * 8) = 1200 +

        6. What will be the index of the 100th element in a 1D array of size
        200, given that the array uses negative indexing starting from -50?
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        To find the index of the 100th element, we add 99 to the starting index:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Index of the 100th element = -50 + 99 = 49</strong></p>
      <p>So, the index of the 100th element is 49.</p>

        7. Find the address of A[20] if the base address of a one-dimensional

        1-based indexing.
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

      <p>Using 1-based indexing, the address is calculated using:</p>
      <p>
        <strong

      <p>
        <strong
          >Address of A[20] = 3000 + ((20 - 1) * 4) = 3000 + (19 * 4) = 3000 +

        30th position if the array indexing starts at 10 (0-based)?
      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        To find the index of the 30th element, we add 29 to the starting index:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Index of the 30th element = 10 + 29 = 39</strong></p>
      <p>So, the index of the element in the 30th position is 39.</p>

      </h3>
      <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
      <p>
        To find the address of, we use the formula for calculating the address
