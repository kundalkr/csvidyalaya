                avoidance algorithm that tests whether the system can allocate
                resources to each process in a safe sequence.

              </div>
              <p>
                The name ‚ÄúBanker‚Äôs Algorithm‚Äù comes from a real-world banking scenario that was explained by the famous
                computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>A bank has a fixed amount of money (cash).</li>
                <li>Customers (processes) can request loans (resources).</li>
                <li>Each customer has a maximum limit (how much loan they might request in total).</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The bank wants to ensure that it never gets into a situation where it can't fulfill the needs of any of
                its customers ‚Äî even in the worst case.</p>
              <h3 class="text-center">or</h3>
              <p>The bank must ensure that it never gives out too much money, or it might be unable to fulfill future
                requests.because If a customer later needs more money, but the bank has already loaned out most of its
                cash, it might not be able to help ‚Äî this is a dangerous or unsafe situation. &ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&gt;
                this is similar to a deadlock.
              </p>

              <p>So The Bank Must Avoid a Dangerous or unsafe Situation and to avoid dangerous situations, the bank only
                gives a loan if it can still safely meet the possible future needs of all other customers.</p>

              <h4>The algorithm is called the ‚ÄúBanker‚Äôs Algorithm‚Äù because it behaves like a cautious banker (a banker
                never gives out loans without keeping enough cash to support all customers). Similarly, the OS simulates
                whether it can still fulfill the maximum demands of all other processes before granting a request and
                only allocates resources if it is safe to do so.This method helps the OS avoid deadlock, and keep the
                system running smoothly</h4>

              </div>
              <p>Now we will understand in detail how Bankers algorithm works in the operating system</p>
              <ol>
                <li>In an OS, resources refer to things like: CPU time (processor execution time), Memory (RAM), Disk
                  space, Input/Output devices (like printers, scanners), Files or semaphores
                  These are limited in number, and the OS has to allocate them wisely among processes.</li>
                <li>Before a process begins execution, it tells the OS the maximum number of each type of resource it
                  might need.
                  <br>
                  üî∏ This is like a customer telling the bank: ‚ÄúThe most loan I might ever need is ‚Çπ10,000.‚Äù
                  <br>
                  This information allows the OS to plan ahead and avoid allocating resources that could cause future
                  deadlocks.
                </li>
                <li>The OS maintains a list of how many instances of each resource are currently available.

                  <br> Example: 5 printers, 3 CPUs, 10 memory blocks free. <br>

                  When a process makes a request, the OS first checks if the requested resources are available right
                  now.

                </li>
                <li>It then looks at the remaining needs (i.e., how much more each process might request later) by
                  subtracting: <br>

                  Maximum need ‚àí Currently allocated <br>

                  This helps the OS understand the worst-case demands of all processes in the system.</li>
                <li>Before actually giving the resources, the OS performs a simulation:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      It temporarily pretends that the resources have been given.
                    </li>
                    <li> Then it checks: Can all processes still finish eventually, one after the other, if needed?</li>
                  </ul>
                  This is known as the "safety check".
                </li>
                <li>If the simulation shows that the system will remain safe then, The OS grants the resource request
                  and The process continues its work.</li>
                <li>But if the system might go into an unsafe state (possible future deadlock) then , The OS denies the
                  request, even if the resources are currently free.
                </li>
              </ol>

                Step 1: Identify the available resources and maximum demand of
                each process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 2: Calculate the "Need" matrix by subtracting the
                allocated resources from the maximum demand for each process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 3: Check if the system has a safe state by allocating
                resources based on the "Need" matrix while ensuring the system
                remains in a safe state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 4: Allocate resources to processes only if they satisfy
                the "Need" matrix and resources are available.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 5: If a safe sequence is found, allocate resources; if
                not, resources remain unallocated to prevent deadlock.

            </div>
            <p>
              Banker's Algorithm is better than other deadlock prevention
              algorithms as it dynamically checks for safe and unsafe states
              based on each process's resource needs, ensuring efficient
              resource utilization. Unlike static resource allocation methods,
              it provides a safe sequence, preventing deadlock while allowing
              processes to request resources flexibly. This adaptability makes
              it effective in multi-process systems with stable resources.
