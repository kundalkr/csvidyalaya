              What is Buddy System in Operating System ?
            </h2>
            <p>
              The Buddy System is a memory allocation and management technique
              used in operating systems. It divides the memory into partitions
              to satisfy memory allocation requests while trying to minimize
              fragmentation. In this method, memory is split into blocks of size
              equal to powers of 2.

          <h2>Method to Solve Buddy System Questions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Identify the size of the memory block required for allocation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find the smallest power of 2 that can accommodate the required
              memory size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Split the available memory block iteratively into smaller blocks
              (buddies) until the required block size is obtained.
            </li>
            <li>Allocate the memory block to the requesting process.</li>
            <li>
              When the process releases the memory, merge it with its buddy if
              the buddy is free, forming a larger block.
            </li>
            <li>
              Repeat the process for subsequent allocation or deallocation
              requests.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Why Buddy System is Better Than Other Algorithms</h2>
          <p>
            The Buddy System is often preferred over other memory allocation
            algorithms (like
            <a
              href="/os/memory_management/Fit_question.html#first_fit"

              title="what is first fit ?"
              >First Fit</a
            >,
            <a
              href="/os/memory_management/Fit_question.html#best_fit"
              target="_blank"
              title="what is best fit ?"
              >Best Fit</a
            >,
            <a
              href="/os/memory_management/Fit_question.html#next_fit"
              target="_blank"
              title="what is next fit ?"
              >Next Fit</a
            >
            and
            <a
              href="/os/memory_management/Fit_question.html#worst_fit"
              target="_blank"
              title="what is worst fit ?"
              >Worst Fit</a
            >) due to its efficient block splitting and merging mechanism, which
            minimizes internal fragmentation and allows for quick allocation and
            deallocation. Its use of power-of-2 block sizes simplifies memory
            management and reduces the complexity of maintaining free memory
            lists. However, it still requires careful management to handle
            external fragmentation effectively.
