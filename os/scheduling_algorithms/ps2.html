            <h2>What Is Preemptive Priority Scheduling in Operating Systems?</h2>
            <p>
              Preemptive Priority Scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm where
              each process is assigned a priority level. The CPU is allocated to
              the process with the highest priority, and if a new process with a
              higher priority arrives, the currently running process is
              preempted and the CPU is allocated to the new process.
            </p>

            <h2>Method to Solve Preemptive Priority Scheduling Problems</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Assign a priority level to each process.</li>
              <li>
                Sort the processes in a priority queue based on their priority
                levels, with the highest priority first.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the CPU becomes available, allocate it to the process with
                the highest priority.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a new process arrives with a higher priority than the current
                running process, preempt the running process and allocate the
                CPU to the new process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Continue this process until all tasks are completed,
                re-evaluating the priority queue as new processes arrive or are
                completed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Calculate metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and
                response time for performance analysis.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
              Why Preemptive Priority Scheduling is Better Than Other Algorithms?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Preemptive Priority Scheduling is often better than other
              scheduling algorithms, like First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) or
              Round Robin, because it can prioritize critical or time-sensitive
              processes. This feature is beneficial in real-time systems where
              certain tasks must complete within a specific time frame, making
              it a flexible and efficient choice for priority-driven
              environments.
            </p>

            <h2>
              Why Preemptive Priority Scheduling is Not the Best Algorithm for
              CPU Scheduling
            </h2>
            <p>
              Despite its advantages, Preemptive Priority Scheduling has
              limitations, such as the risk of starvation for low-priority
              processes and high context-switching overhead. Additionally,
              setting and managing priorities can be complex, especially for
              dynamic workloads. As a result, it may not be the best choice for
              general-purpose operating systems that require fair and balanced
              CPU allocation for all processes.
