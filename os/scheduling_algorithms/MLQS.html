            <p>
              In the Multilevel Queue Scheduling algorithm, the processes are
              divided into multiple queues based on specific characteristics,
              such as process priority or memory requirements. Each queue has
              its own scheduling algorithm, which could be

            <ul>
              <li>
                Step 1: Divide the processes into multiple queues based on
                priority or process type.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 2: Assign a scheduling algorithm to each queue according to
                the specific requirements of the processes in that queue.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 3: Define the priority levels among queues, determining
                which queue should be given preference when multiple queues have
                processes ready to run.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 4: If a process completes its execution in its assigned
                queue, it is removed; otherwise, it may be moved to another
                queue as per the system’s defined rules.
              </li>
              <li>
                Step 5: Repeat the above steps until all processes in all queues
                are completed.

              Why Multilevel Queue Scheduling Is Better than Other Scheduling
              Algorithms?
            </h2>

            <p>
              Multilevel Queue Scheduling is particularly beneficial in
              environments where different categories of tasks require distinct
              scheduling policies. By allowing separate
              <a
                href="/os/scheduling_algorithms/Scheduling_Alorithms_topic.html"
                >scheduling algorithms</a
              >
              per queue and facilitating priority-based processing, it can
              deliver more efficient performance compared to a single algorithm
              for all processes. This makes it highly suitable for systems
              requiring quick responses for specific types of processes, as well
              as in multiuser environments, where prioritizing system tasks can
              help maintain system stability and responsiveness.

            <h2>where multilevel queue scheduling (MLQ) used ?</h2>
            <p>
              Multilevel Queue Scheduling (MLQ) is used in computer systems
              where different types of tasks need to be managed efficiently.
              It's like organizing tasks into separate "queues" based on their
              priority or type. <br />
              for example :
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>1. Real-Time Systems: </strong>Tasks that need immediate
                attention, like handling incoming video streams or medical
                devices, can be placed in a high-priority queue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>2. Interactive Systems: </strong>Tasks like typing on a
                keyboard or moving the mouse are placed in another queue to
                ensure they respond quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>3. Batch Systems: </strong>Background tasks, such as
                file downloads or backups, are placed in a lower-priority queue
                since they don’t need instant results.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By keeping tasks in separate queues, MLQ scheduling helps systems
              run smoothly and prioritize the most critical tasks first. It’s
              often used in operating systems and servers to manage resources
              efficiently.
